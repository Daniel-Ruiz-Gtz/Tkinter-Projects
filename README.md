# Tkinter Practice Repository

Welcome to my Tkinter Practice Repository! This repository is dedicated to my personal practice with Tkinter, where I explore various projects to enhance my skills in building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with Python.
This repository includes multiple Tkinter projects, each designed to focus on different aspects of Tkinter and GUI development.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Daniel-Ruiz-Gtz/Tkinter-Projects.git
   cd Tkinter-Projects
   ```

2. **Run a Project:**
   Navigate to a specific project directory and run the main Python file.
   ```bash
   cd project_name
   python main.py
   ```
